1. Improve reading capability
I realise that's a lot more difficult than it sounds, but it became immediately apparent as a potential issue. To the questions "How can i backup Wordpress?" and "How do i backup a Wordpress database?" i got the same exact answer. It was appropriate for the first question, but incorrect as an answer to the second.
When i asked "What is the difference between Drupal and Wordpress?" the chatbot explained the difference between Wordpress.com and Wordpress.org.
When i asked "What is Drupal used for?" it explained what tags are.

2. Reduce faff(increase effectiveness)
Jokes and anecdotes have a time and a place, but they don't belong in a chatbot. When i asked the question "What is responsive web design?" i got the answer "Socrates once said "Web design describes the visual appearance of a website. The traditional approach involves contrast, coloring, balance, emphasis, rhythm, style of graphical elements (lines, shapes, texture, color and direction), use of icons, background textures and general atmosphere of overall website design."

It takes only 10 seconds to read, but that's 10 seconds wasted and me getting frustrated with the lack of help and potentially closing the chat. If you are going to quote Ancient Greek philosophers, keep the quotes short.

3. Improve Sources
The chatbot suggested this page as a useful resouce - http://www.arawebsitedesign.com/what_is_website_design_66.htm
Though it is sort of relevant to the question i ask it seems quite outdated and not the optimal source for info.
